# FundBox Front-end Assignment

## How to run this application
 - Clone the repository
 - Open src/index.html in the browser

### Notes:
- I had already created most of the app without using any framework (react) based on instructions from the 1st assignment.
- But given more time I would  refactor the player code and move it to a react component
- I spent ~6-7 hours creating this app but received new instructions today so the github commit / done does not reflect correct done time.
